# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a research and data scientist, with a keen interest in addressing and solving real-life questions using R/Python programming and statistical analysis techniques. Currently I am working with a life science research group by day.   

I enjoy doing things that require creativity and problem solving.
